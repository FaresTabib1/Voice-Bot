# Voice-Bot
This project is a Flask-based web application developed for a training service provider to assist clients in asking and receiving clarifications about training programs. The voice-bot integrates advanced voice recognition, sentiment analysis, and hate speech detection, offering both voice and text-based interaction for a seamless user experience.

# Features

Voice and Text Interaction: Enables clients to ask questions about training topics using their voice or text.

Sentiment Analysis: Uses BERT to analyze user emotions, classifying them into five categories:

- Joy / Sadness / Neutral / Fear / Anger
